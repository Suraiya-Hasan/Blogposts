Hey there! I'm **Suraiya Hasan**, and I wanted to give you a little insight into my world today. Currently, I'm a final year student at the **Islamic University of Technology, majoring in Software Engineering**. It's a challenging journey, but I'm passionate about technology and excited about what the future holds.

In the tech realm, I've been diving deep into web development. I've got a toolkit that includes **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, and Next.js**. These skills have allowed me to create some pretty cool web applications, and I'm always eager to learn more.

When I'm not buried in code or textbooks, you can find me indulging in my hobbies. I'm a proud cat parent to two adorable furballs, and they never fail to make me smile with their playful antics. I'm currently engrossed in the series **"American Housewife"** - it's a hilarious escape from the demands of student life.

Speaking of escapes, books are another one of my passions. Right now, I'm engrossed in **"King of Pride" by Ana Huang.** The story is gripping, and I can't wait to see where it takes me.

That's a glimpse of me for today! Stay tuned for more updates from my world.
